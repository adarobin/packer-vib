# packer-vib

This repository contains content to build a vib file for ESXi. The goal is to configure a host to enable use as a target for the [Packer VMware builders](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/vmware.html).

Specifically, it:

* Configures the firewall to allow VNC access
* Enables SSH and suppresses the warning message
* Enables the GuestIPHack advanced option

This has been tested with ESXi 6.0 Update 3, ESXi 6.5 Update 2, and ESXi 6.7.
It is possible it would work with ESXi 5.5.

If using this with ESXi 6.5 or 6.7, VNC password support seems to have been
removed. You must set `vnc_disable_password` to `true` in your Packer template.

## Install Instructions

In ESXi execute:

```sh
esxcli software acceptance set --level=CommunitySupported
esxcli software vib install -v https://github.com/umich-vci/packer-vib/releases/download/v1.0.0-1/packer.vib
```

## Build Instructions (docker)

In a Linux host with docker installed, use the [lamw/vibauthor](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/lamw/vibauthor) container to build:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/root lamw/vibauthor \
    vibauthor -C -t stage -v packer.vib -O packer-offline-bundle.zip -f
```

## Build Instructions (CentOS)

In a CentOS 6.6 host install the [vib-author fling](https://flings.vmware.com/vib-author) dependency:

```bash
curl -O https://download3.vmware.com/software/vmw-tools/vibauthor/vmware-esx-vib-author-5.0.0-0.0.847598.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh vmware-esx-vib-author-5.0.0-0.0.847598.i386.rpm
```

Then build:

```bash
vibauthor -C -t stage -v packer.vib -O packer-offline-bundle.zip -f
```
